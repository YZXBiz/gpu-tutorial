## How to Use This Tutorial

### Progressive Learning Path
Start with Chapter 1 and work sequentially. Each chapter builds on previous concepts.

### Structure of Each Chapter
1. **Numbered TOC** - Quick navigation to specific topics
2. **Plain English Explanations** - Concepts before jargon
3. **Visual Breakdowns** - ASCII diagrams for complex ideas
4. **Insight Boxes** - Key patterns that apply broadly
5. **Concrete Examples** - Real numbers and working scenarios
6. **Key Takeaways** - Summary at chapter end

### Reading Time
Most chapters take 20-40 minutes to read thoroughly.

### Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge (C/C++ helpful but not required)
- Curiosity about parallel computing
- No GPU programming experience needed

## Navigation Tips

- Each chapter has **Previous/Next** links at the bottom
- Use the **Table of Contents** to jump to specific sections
- Look for **💡 Key Pattern** boxes for transferable insights

## Learning Philosophy

This tutorial follows these principles:

**Show → Name → Explain → Apply**
1. See the concept with an analogy
2. Learn the technical term
3. Understand the mechanism
4. Apply it in code

**No Fluff Policy:**
- Every example should be actionable
- Technical terms are explained on first use
- Redundant explanations are removed
- Context and motivation are preserved

**Progressive Complexity:**
- Simple case first (single item, single operation)
- Then intermediate (multiple items, parallelization)
- Finally advanced (real constraints, optimization)

# GPU Programming Tutorial

A clear, practical learning path for GPU programming and parallel computing, transformed from technical textbook content into accessible, hands-on material.

## What This Is

This tutorial takes dense technical book content about GPU programming and transforms it into:
- **Plain English explanations** with concrete examples
- **Progressive complexity** from simple to advanced concepts
- **Visual breakdowns** of complex topics
- **Practical, working code** examples
- **Real-world applications** and use cases

## Structure

- `docs/` - Transformed tutorial chapters
- `raw/` - Original source material
- `CLAUDE.md` - Transformation guidelines

## Current Status

✅ Chapter 1: Introduction to GPU Programming

## Topics Covered

- Why GPUs became essential after 2003
- CPU vs GPU architecture and design philosophies
- Parallel programming challenges and patterns
- CUDA programming basics
- Performance optimization techniques
- Real-world applications (deep learning, scientific computing, graphics)

## Target Audience

- Developers new to GPU programming
- Students learning parallel computing
- Engineers transitioning to CUDA/GPU development
- Anyone curious about how modern parallel computing works

## Learning Approach

Each chapter follows the pattern:
1. **Show the concept** with everyday analogies
2. **Explain the mechanism** with technical terms
3. **Provide working examples** with code
4. **Highlight key patterns** that apply broadly

No fluff, no redundant explanations—just clear paths from concept to implementation.
